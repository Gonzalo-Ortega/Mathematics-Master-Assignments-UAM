\subsubsection*{Exercise 3.}

  If $ f \in K[x_0, x_1, x_2] $ be a non-constant homogeneous polynomial and let $ f = \prod_{i=1}^n g_i^{m_i} $ be the decomposition of $ f $ in irreducible polynomials.

\subsubsection*{(a)}
  \begin{proof} \

    \vspace{1mm}
    ($\Rightarrow$)
    If $ V(f) $ is irreducible, suppose that we can not write $ f $ as a power of a irreducible polynomial. Then, there exist $ g_1, g_2 \in K[x_0, x_1, x_2] $, with $ g_1 \neq g_2 $, such that $ f = g_1 g_2 $. But then we have $ V(f) = V(g_1 g_2) = V(g_1) \cup V(g_2) $ as seen in Remark 3.9 of \cite{gath}. This is a contradiction as $ V(f) $ is irreducible so it need to be $ f = g^m $ for some $g$ irreducible.

    \vspace{1mm}
    ($\Leftarrow$)
    If $ f = g^m $, with $ g $ irreducible, then we have $ V(f) = V(g^m) = V(g) $. $ V(g) $ needs to be irreducible, because if not it could be expressed as the union of two curves $ V(g_1) $ and $ V(g_2) $, having $ V(g) = V(g_1) \cap V(g_2) = V(g_1 g_2) $, and it would be $ g =  g_1^m g_2^m $ contradicting the fact of $ g $ being irreducible. Thus, $ V(g^m) $ is irreducible.
  \end{proof}

\subsubsection*{(b)}
  \begin{proof}
    For $ n = 1 $, $ f = g_1^{m_1} $, so $ g_1^{m_1} $ is homogeneous and so $ g_1 $, as $ f $ is homogeneous. Suppose $ h = \prod_{i=1}^{n-1} g_i^{m_i} $ homogeneous. If $ g_n $ was not homogeneous, $ g_n^{m_n} $ neither would be, and the product $ h g_n^{m_n} $ would not be homogeneous as the product of an homogeneous and a non homogeneous polynomials can not be homogeneous. But $ h g_n^{m_n} = \prod_{i=1}^n g_i^{m_i} = f $ contradicting the fact of $ f $ been homogeneous. Thus $ g_n $ must be homogeneous and, because of induction, each $ g_i $ is homogeneous.

    \vspace{1mm}
    As each $ g_i $ is an homogeneous irreducible polynomial, because of {\bf (a)}, $ V(g_i) $ is a irreducible curve. Therefor, $ V(f) = \cup_i V(g_i) $ is a decomposition in irreducible curves of $ V(f) $.
  \end{proof}
